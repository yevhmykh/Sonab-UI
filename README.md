# Sonab (UI)

This is project doesn't make some usefull work. :smirk:
It's just example of my code. I used nickname generator to create its name. :wink:
Maybe UI can be better... Well I'm not designer. :upside_down_face:

## But what it do? :question:

This is some kind of forum with posts and some other staff... I think... I hope... :relieved:

## What interesting here?

Auth0, SignalR notifications.

## Problems :frowning_face:

I tried implement http request loader via HttpInterceptor, but I failed... :anguished: Why? HttpInterceptor for some generates 2 events per request, where the second request doesn't finalize. As a result, the loader doesn't disappear. :rage: I don't know why and how to fix it. :cry:

## How to run it?

Some Auth0 functionality requires sensitive data, but I will not attach this data to repository. So if you want to run it follow next steps:
1. Create an Auth0 account
2. Create a new single page application and configure it accordingly for quick start tab(Don't worry. It's free :wink:)
3. Set credentials in environment and Auth0 config files. Now you can start...
